% STC89xx series, which is produced by STC MCU Limited, is a 8-bit single-chip microcontroller with a fully
% compatible instruction set with industrial-standard 80C51 series microcontroller. There is 64K bytes flash
% memory embeded for appliaction program, which is shared with In-System-Programming code.In-SystemProgramming (ISP) and In-Application-Programming (IAP) support the users to upgrade the program and data
% in system. ISP allows the user to download new code without removing the microcontroller from the actual end
% product;IAP means that the device can write non-valatile data in Flash memory while the application program
% is running. There are 1280 bytes or 512 bytes on-chip RAM embedded that provides requirement from wide
% field application. The user can configure the device to run in 12 clocks per machine cycle, and to get the same
% performance just as he uses another standard 80C51 device that is provided by other vendor, or 6 clocks per
% machine cycle to achieve twice performance. The STC89xx series retain all features of the standard 80C51. In
% addition, the STC89xx series have a extra I/O port (P4 ), Timer 2, a 8-sources, 4-priority-level interrupt structure,
% on-chip crystal oscillator,and a one-time enabled Watchdog Timer.
